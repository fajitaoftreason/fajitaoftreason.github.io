<h3>Programming</h3>
<p>I enjoy both playing and programming games as well as programming in general.  I have an interest in involving realistic physics in games.  I wrote an Asteroids clone  in PyGame which is intended to reward you for moving around.  I never fully completed it, but you can view the source code at its <a href="https://github.com/fajitaoftreason/redshift">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>I also recently wrote a python script which ran a various number of methods of doing numerical approximation for an integral which represented magnetic force in a system.  I was interested in the efficiency of each method, and so I put the results of each method on a graph to show how quickly each one converged with the results of direct integration.
