        <h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I am an Interdisciplinary Studies major at University of Central Florida with a minor in Computer Science, and focus areas in  Psychology and Physics.  I was introduced to computer programming and robotics at my high school and have continued to have a passion for creation ever since.</p>
          <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
          <p>When I was a young woman growing up in Narnia, I had a power bestowed upon me.  This was the power to bend technology to my will and force it to obey me.  The elder witch from whom I gained this power called it a "Keyboard,"
              and with it I found the keys to unlimited power.  When I was reincarnated into this world, I searched to regain this power, and found that keyboards were in fact abundant, despite most people not using them to their full potential.  I swore as a small child to reclaim the power of the keyboard, and use it to make the world a cooler place with better tech. </p> 
          <p>I became interested in using my power to make awesome robots, and during my sojourn at UCF, discovered that robots are even cooler when they fly.  I therefore endeavoured to create a sweet flying robot which would be able to take in information and avoid flying into people, since doing that would violate Issac Asimov's first law of robotics.</p>
          <p>I'm always interested in a good puzzle, which is probably why I was drawn to programming.  There are endless solutions to endless problems, and even when you've found a solution which works, there's another puzzle in how to make it more efficient, or faster.</p>
