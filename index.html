        <h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I graduated from University of Central Florida with an Interdisciplinary Studies major with a minor in Computer Science, and focus areas in  Psychology and Physics.  I was introduced to computer programming and robotics at my high school and have continued to have a passion for creation ever since.</p>
          <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
          <p>I swore as a small child to claim the power of the keyboard, and use it to make the world a cooler place with better tech. </p> 
          <p>I became interested in using my power to make awesome robots, and during my sojourn at UCF, discovered that robots are even cooler when they fly.  I therefore endeavoured to create a sweet flying robot which would be able to take in information and avoid flying into people, since doing that would violate Isaac Asimov's first law of robotics.</p>
          <p>I'm always interested in a good puzzle, which is probably why I was drawn to programming.  There are endless solutions to endless problems, and even when you've found a solution which works, there's another puzzle in how to make it more efficient, or faster.</p>
          <h3>More Information</h3>
